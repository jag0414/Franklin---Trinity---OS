# Trinity AI Consolidation & Security Report

## Summary
Unified orchestrator in `trinity_orchestrator_unified.py` now serves as single routing hub. Legacy file `trinity_orchestrator_v2.py` removed. Test harness simplified (`trinity_test.py`) to avoid direct client duplication. Added centralized env configuration via `config.py`.

## Environment Keys
- GEMINI_API_KEY
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

Central access: `config.get_config()`; missing keys logged once during client creation.

## Secret Scan Results
No hard-coded API keys, bearer tokens, or passwords detected in Python/JS (only environment references). Pool Builder and BidNova handle auth dynamically.

## Recommended Hardening (Next Steps)
1. Add key presence validation endpoint (`/health/ai`) returning which engines active.
2. Introduce structured logging (JSON) for orchestrator failovers (engine, error class, latency).
3. Implement rate limiting (FastAPI: `slowapi` or custom middleware) to prevent abuse.
4. Add password hashing to BidNova if persistence added (`passlib[bcrypt]`).
5. Exclude vendor docs (`.rustup/`) from future secret scans.
6. Consider per-engine timeout wrappers (async + `asyncio.wait_for`) if moving to async framework.
7. Optional: metrics export (latency histogram) via `prometheus_client`.

## Deprecations
- Removed: `trinity_orchestrator_v2.py` (redundant)
- Replaced direct engine test scripts with unified harness in `trinity_test.py`.

## Centralization Benefits
- Single point for key management.
- Reduced duplicate client init logic.
- Easier extension via handler registry.

## Open Items (If Needed)
- JS/TS env var centralization (config shim) for Pool Builder.
- Add integration test file under `tests/` invoking `trinity_engine` with mocked clients.

## Verification
Run: `python trinity_test.py` to exercise routing. Missing keys are reported without breaking unrelated engines.
